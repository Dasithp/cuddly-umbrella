## R Markdown #header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) #R code goes here
```
#cache=TRUE
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} 
plot(pressure)
```
#echo=FALSE does not show code but shows output
#eval=FALSE shows code but doesn't generate output
#include=FALSE run the code but won't see the code or output
#echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3 allows to manipulate size of graph
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is the mean speed of all cars: `r mean(cars$speed)`
